About the Game
The Cursed King is a game about greed and misfortune. Also, a game about choices! This is a game built in HTML, CSS and JavaScript as a part of a Ironhack project.

So what is the story?
You are a king, lusting for power, that somehow made a deal with the devil. You want to be king forever! But that's the only thing you asked for. Being king can be an exhausting task, but you have to keep the balance in your kingdom somehow.
